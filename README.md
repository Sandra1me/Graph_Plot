# Graph Plot

![MainUI](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2854935-b682-4ed4-a14b-1216f4e1ed0c)

Create different types of graphs (curves, surfaces) to represent simple mathematical functions and their derivatives.

## Installation

Download and double-click on the GraphPlot.mlapp to execute MATLAB and run the app. Alternatively, you can find the complete code in the GraphPlot_Code.m file.

## Usage

Select the range for the x-axis (horizontal axis). The default value is from -10 to 10.

Then select the function to plot, or insert a custom one.

WARNING!

If you write a custom function, it is important to use the dot notation. 
Examples:
x.*sin(x)
x.^2
2*sin(x)

To plot the function, click the "Plot" button. The "Clear" button will clear the graph.

## Roadmap

I plan to add 3D plots shortly, with custom functions.
